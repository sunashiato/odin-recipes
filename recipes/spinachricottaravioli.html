        <li><strong>PREPARE INGREDIENTS</strong>: 
            Bring 2 litres salted water to a boil in a large pot.
            Wash, pick and tear sage leaves into 1/2 inch pieces.
            Drain ground turkey and pat dry with paper towel. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li><strong>COOK RAVIOLI:</strong> 
            Once water boils add ravioli and cook for 6–7 minutes or until al dente.
            Reserve 1 cup pasta water and drain in a sieve.</li>

        <li><strong>COOK TURKEY:</strong> 
            Begin this step once ravioli is added to pot.
            Heat 1 tbsp. oil in a second large pot over medium-high.
            Once hot, add ground turkey and spice blend and cook for 3–4 minutes.
            Use a wooden spoon to break apart and cook until turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.</li>

        <li><strong>PREPARE SAUCE:</strong>
            Reduce heat to medium on pot with turkey.
            Add walnuts, sage and garlic and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant.
            Add whipping cream, pumpkin puree, half of both parmesan and pasta water.
            Cook 1–2 minutes until sauce slightly thickens.
            Add 1 tbsp. butter, ravioli and spinach to pot and toss to coat ravioli in sauce and wilt spinach.
            Add 1 tbsp. pasta water at a time until desired consistency is reached.
            Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li><strong>SERVE:</strong>
            Divide ravioli between serving bowls.
